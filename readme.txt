Please follow these steps to run this code on your local pc.

1) Set up the "desitnation" folder into your local setup.

2) Create the database with any name on your local pc, I a using "airl" this database name in this code, if you will create with same db name then you don`t need to change the db name in code.

3) In this folder there is a sql file named "airl.sql", please import this file into the database that you just created.

4) Go to this location file desitnation->includes->database.php, here please change the database name, database user name and database user password.

5) Now you have setup this, if you are using linux pc then please set the 777 permission to this folder with command prompat, if window pc then no need to set permission.

6) Now open this in browser, in my case the url is - http://localhost/destination/

7) For testing I have setup 2 locations, click on any of the name 'Tucson, Willcox', full detail for this location will show on then.
